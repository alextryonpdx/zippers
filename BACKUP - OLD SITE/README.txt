### Folders ###

Contained within your home directory here are three folders:

logs         - This contains recent access and error logs for your website (read-only)
private      - You can put files and folders here that you do not want accessible to the web server
public_html  - Place your web pages and anything public facing here, including sub-folders



### To Upload a Website ###

To upload a website, place files within the public_html folder.  They can then
be addressed with http://www.yoursite.com/yourfile.html.  This web server also
supports common scripting languages such as PHP, Perl, and Python.  To make a
page load from http://www.yourdomain.com, be sure the page is named index.html,
index.php, or index.pl

Note: All filenames are case sensitive.  Index.html is not the same as index.html
